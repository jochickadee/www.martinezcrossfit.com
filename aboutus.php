          <h1>The Martinez CrossFit Story:</h1>
          <p class="well">Martinez CrossFit was born from an idea, and more importantly a passion for helping people achieve their goals. We are only successful if our athletes are successful and we truly believe that the accomplishments of our athletes speak to our commitment to them and the hard work they put in. We incorporate functional movements with every workout, from bodyweight movements, barbells, kettle bells, along with cardio based exercise to help us achieve fitness and life goals. Working out is not just “looking good” but it is about feeling good and getting that release from everyday life stress and struggles.</p>

          <p>Ralphie found CrossFit back in 2007 and dabbled in and out of programming workouts for fun ever since. He started a garage gym in 2013 with a few mats, minimal equipment, some friends and family members, and a personal training certificate. Since then he has become a Level 1 CrossFit trainer, along with making his garage gym the only CrossFit affiliate in the city. His passion for helping people is what initially drove him to start this endeavor and the athletes he trains and the results they are getting are what keep him motivated to better himself every day. He’s longed for a place for athletes of all stages of fitness to be able to get better and be a part of a team atmosphere, and he is trying to build that place.</p>
